We improve the railway for the millions of people who use it every single day.The routes trains travel, and the times at which they do so, must be carefully and intricately planned. By making sure trains follow the right paths at the right times, we make sure passengers and freight arrive at their destinations safely and on time.

It�s also hugely rewarding.","line-8":"Brief Description","line-9":"Who are we looking for?As a timetable planner you are tasked with crafting train timetables, carefully analysing and balancing a wide range of factors � ultimately, you make vital decisions that impact on millions of people and organisations.You will be great at solving complex problems, working as part of a supportive team you will balance the needs of our customers to maximise capacity and performance of the rail network.Who are we looking for?As a timetable planner you are tasked with crafting train timetables, carefully analysing and balancing a wide range of factors � ultimately, you make vital decisions that impact on millions of people and organisations.You will be great at solving complex problems, working as part of a supportive team you will balance the needs of our customers to maximise capacity and performance of the rail network.Who are we looking for?As a timetable planner you are tasked with crafting train timetables, carefully analysing and balancing a wide range of factors � ultimately, you make vital decisions that impact on millions of people and organisations.You will be great at solving complex problems, working as part of a supportive team you will balance the needs of our customers to maximise capacity and performance of the rail network.","line-10":"Who are we looking for?As a timetable planner you are tasked with crafting train timetables, carefully analysing and balancing a wide range of factors � ultimately, you make vital decisions that impact on millions of people and organisations.You will be great at solving complex problems, working as part of a supportive team you will balance the needs of our customers to maximise capacity and performance of the rail network.Who are we looking for?As a timetable planner you are tasked with crafting train timetables, carefully analysing and balancing a wide range of factors � ultimately, you make vital decisions that impact on millions of people and organisations.You will be great at solving complex problems, working as part of a supportive team you will balance the needs of our customers to maximise capacity and performance of the rail network.","line-11":"Who are we looking for?As a timetable planner you are tasked with crafting train timetables, carefully analysing and balancing a wide range of factors � ultimately, you make vital decisions that impact on millions of people and organisations.You will be great at solving complex problems, working as part of a supportive team you will balance the needs of our customers to maximise capacity and performance of the rail network.","line-12":"About the role (External)","line-13":"What does the average day look like? In this role, you will be building train timetables.
