"An exciting opportunity with Southern Region to lead our Cultural Change Programme, Southern Region. Within the Southern Regions plan, we have three clear principles to help us face current challenges within the region and to help us become Better Together Southern. ​​​​​​​They describe how we want to work together and create a culture that people want to be part of as we move forward, together. They describe how we can look at our attitudes and behaviours at work and make changes in our approach where necessary. In short, they help us think about what it means to be a Southern Region employee. Collectively, they shine the spotlight on three key ways of working that can help us think about how we do our jobs and what we’re willing to change – in our everyday activities, what we do, how we do it, the way we interact with others and the decisions we make. Your role will be to take the lead with this exciting change programme what has a number of workstreams from on-going programmes, to accelerated target areas and new progressive workstreams across the region, great progress has been made so far with this programme, the next steps will be to take this emersion and rollout across Southern Region."
