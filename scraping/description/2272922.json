"Our conventional railway network requires a number of modifications to enable the construction and operation of HS2. The works include demolition, land clearance, alterations to track, signalling and power supplies as well as the building of new maintenance depots, bridges, and sidings. Known as On Network Works (ONW), these projects are a crucial feature of HS2â€™s wider enabling works, or early works, and will continue into the main construction phase. As a Project Manager in this team, you will work across the ONW infrastructure investment from minor through to complex multi-disciplinary projects and remain accountable for managing the safe and effective delivery to meet client requirements, to time, cost, quality, and performance."
