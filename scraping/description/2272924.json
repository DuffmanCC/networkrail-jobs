"The Internal Design Team (IDT) is expanding to meet demand brought about by our continued success in project delivery and is looking for talented people from all backgrounds to join our journey and move us forward. Our team deals with a wide range of engineering projects such as structural repair works, retaining structures, sea defences, bridge refurbishments and geotechnical works such as embankment regrades and slopes analysis. We also operate on large scale schemes such as our award-winning work on Liverpool High Neck Tunnel and our refurbishments of Ribblehead and Sankey viaduct to name but a few. We are again happy to be looking for another candidate to join our diversely capable team for a bright and fulfilling career in civil engineering with a focus on safety and look forward to hearing from you. As a CAD technician for IDT your duties will include ‘red-line’ mark-up drawing amendments, on-site scanning and clerical tasks such as assisting the team with bookings and submitting time sheets. As such experience in Excel is highly advantageous with experience in Access desirable. This would be an excellent opportunity for a recent graduate with possibilities for future development."
