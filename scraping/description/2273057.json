"An introduction to WessexWe run one of the busiest parts of Britain's railway, with 212 million passenger journeys across our network every year. Waterloo station is the busiest in the country with around 330,000 passengers a day – equal to four full capacity crowds at the Twickenham stadium. ​ Our purpose is to connect people, businesses and communities, to support economic growth for all. I firmly believe it is only when we put passengers and freight at the heart of our operations, will we ensure our customers safely get to where they want to go on time, whilst keeping them informed and minimising service impacts during any potential disruption. We serve the South and the South West of Britain connecting cities and towns from our three managed stations at Waterloo, Guildford and Clapham Junction to places such as Bournemouth and Southampton. Our Infrastructure Maintenance Depots are based across the Wessex Route, from Central London, Woking, Portsmouth, Bournemouth, Salisbury & Yeovil. We are currently recruiting for the following locations: Woking, Guildford & FelthamWant to learn more about what it’s like working in our maintenance teams, please click here https://www.networkrail.co.uk/stories/whats-it-like-to-work-in-maintenance-engineering"
