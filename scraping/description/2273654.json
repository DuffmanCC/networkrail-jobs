"This role is at the heart of working with customers and stakeholders to plan for the future of our railway in the west, so that it continues to deliver what our passengers, freight users, and communities need. As Strategic Planner for your dedicated section of the route you will have the opportunity to work with a diverse and motivated group of internal and external stakeholders to identify and develop improvement strategies. You will have the opportunity to get intimately involved in new stations aspirations and potential service improvements, helping to advise on which and how to progress. You will also get to grapple with the big challenges including decarbonisation and levelling up â€“ helping to set out how our railway can support the society we want to live in the short, middle, and long term. You will come to develop an excellent understanding of the areas we serve through your ability to build productive relationships across the board. You will be a key contact for influential external stakeholders including Subnational Transport Bodies and other strategic transport planning partners, helping them achieve their goals. You will be supported by a welcoming and inclusive strategic planning team, and become part of the wider Wales & Western Investment team, where you will work closely with sponsors to make sure that the strategic benefits you identify are translated into deliverable outcomes. You will find opportunities to grow both within the strategic planning team and in the wider investment team, and you will find that the breadth the role brings stands you in good stead for your next move. This is a fascinating and critical time for strategic rail planning, and you will have a real opportunity to shape the system for decades to come. Please note there are 2 job opportunities available"
