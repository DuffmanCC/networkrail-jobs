"The Capital Delivery Renewals and Minor Enhancements organisation is forecast to deliver £1.7bn of investment in CP7, through its four region-wide delivery teams. Each team is accountable for a portfolio focused on specific engineering disciplines / asset types. Our core purpose is based around specifying efficient, value for money solutions, progressing optimal procurement strategies, and ensuring a proportionate and effective approach to assurance. We are recruiting two key Principal Portfolio Manager roles, one to lead our Buildings Renewals and Enhancements team, and the other leading our Electrification & Plant portfolio. In addition to this functional accountability, these roles will also lead on senior stakeholder relationships in the Route where they are based, hence Stratford (supporting Anglia) and Derby (supporting East Midlands) are our preferred locations. We are looking for a proven senior leader, delivering railway projects in Network Rail or our supply chain. You’ll offer a diverse set of skills and experience, be able to set direction for a large internal team and manage key stakeholder relationships with Network Rail colleagues and with the supply chain."
