Following rules and instructions - it is important that you understand and respect the rules, but also feel confident to challenge if you see a situation is unsafe. Willingness to learn - you�ll consistently develop your skills and competencies relevant to your discipline, keeping up to date with new standards, procedures, and instructions.\"]},\"line-6\":\"About Network Rail\"}"
