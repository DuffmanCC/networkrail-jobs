East West Rail Ltd are a body entirely separate from Network Rail, but the Senior Development Manager will act as Network Rail's project sponsor, working closely with our asset protection team to assist East West Rail with the development of their options while also ensuring that Network Rail's interests are protected. The role will require close working with representatives from East West Rail as well as stakeholders from across Network Rail and the industry to ensure that a broad range of views and experience are brought into the design development. Typical activities could include supporting East West Rail with regard to timetable and performance modelling; conducting design reviews with stakeholders; representing Network Rail at optioneering meetings; gathering requirements and managing key interfaces. The senior development manager will also be required to ensure that the asset protection team is adequately funded via funding agreements with East West Rail that will also require the securing of internal authority from Network Rail's panels. In addition to supporting East West Rail, the senior development manager also has a broader role in leading the development of other projects through their early stages by managing the creation of Strategic Outline Business Cases (SOBCs) that can be submitted to government for funding approval. It is important to note that this role is largely focused on projects in the Anglia and the East Midlands Routes. The creation of SOBCs involves similar activities to those described in supporting East West Rail, with the key differences being that Network Rail would lead the work directly ourselves, and would also therefore own the business cases.",
